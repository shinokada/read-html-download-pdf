They don't fundamentally change how React works, and your knowledge of components, props, and top-down data flow is just as relevant.<p>Hooks do have a learning curve of their own.

Make sure everyone on your team is on board with using them and familiar with this documentation. We don't recommend rewriting your existing classes to Hooks unless you planned to rewrite them anyway (e.g. to fix bugs).<p>You can't use Hooks <em>inside</em> a class component, but you can definitely mix classes and function components with Hooks in a single tree. Whether a component is a class or a function that uses Hooks is an implementation detail of that component. In the longer term, we expect Hooks to be the primary way people write React components.</section><section id="do-hooks-cover-all-use-cases-for-classes"class="level3"><h3>Do Hooks cover all use cases for classes?</h3><p>Our goal is for Hooks to cover all use cases for classes as soon as possible. There are no Hook equivalents to the uncommon <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate</code>, <code>getDerivedStateFromError</code> and <code>componentDidCatch</code> lifecycles yet, but we plan to add them soon.</section><section id="do-hooks-replace-render-props-and-higher-order-components"class="level3"><h3>Do Hooks replace render props and higher-order components?</h3><p>Often, render props and higher-order components render only a single child. We think Hooks are a simpler way to serve this use case. There is still a place for both patterns (for example, a virtual scroller component might have a <code>renderItem</code> prop, or a visual container component might have its own DOM structure). But in most cases, Hooks will be sufficient and can help reduce nesting in your tree.</section><section id="what-do-hooks-mean-for-popular-apis-like-redux-connect-and-react-router"class="level3"><h3>What do Hooks mean for popular APIs like Redux <code>connect()</code> and React Router?</h3><p>You can continue to use the exact same APIs as you always have; they'll continue to work.<p>React Redux since v7.1.0 <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks">supports Hooks API</a> and exposes hooks like <code>useDispatch</code> or <code>useSelector</code>.<p>React Router <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Hooks">supports hooks</a> since v5.1.<p>Other libraries might support hooks in the future too.</section><section id="do-hooks-work-with-static-typing"class="level3"><h3>Do Hooks work with static typing?</h3><p>Hooks were designed with static typing in mind. Because they're functions, they are easier to type correctly than patterns like higher-order components. The latest Flow and TypeScript React definitions include support for React Hooks.<p>Importantly, custom Hooks give you the power to constrain React API if you'd like to type them more strictly in some way. React gives you the primitives, but you can combine them in different ways than what we provide out of the box.</section><section id="how-to-test-components-that-use-hooks"class="level3"><h3>How to test components that use Hooks?</h3><p>From React's point of view, a component using Hooks is just a regular component.

The <a href="./hooks-reference.html#useref"><code>useRef()</code></a> Hook isn't just for DOM refs. The "ref" object is a generic container whose <code>current</code> property is mutable and can hold any value, similar to an instance property on a class.<p>You can write to it from inside <code>useEffect</code>:<pre class="language-js{2,8}"><code class="language-js{2,8}">function Timer() {
  const intervalRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      // ...
    });
    intervalRef.current = id;
    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    };
  });

  // ...
}</code></pre><p>If we just wanted to set an interval, we wouldn't need the ref (<code>id</code> could be local to the effect), but it's useful if we want to clear the interval from an event handler:<pre class="language-js{3}"><code class="language-js{3}">  // ...
  function handleCancelClick() {
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
  }
  // ...</code></pre><p>Conceptually, you can think of refs as similar to instance variables in a class. Unless you're doing <a href="#how-to-create-expensive-objects-lazily">lazy initialization</a>, avoid setting refs during rendering -- this can lead to surprising behavior. Instead, typically you want to modify refs in event handlers and effects.</section><section id="should-i-use-one-or-many-state-variables"class="level3"><h3>Should I use one or many state variables?</h3><p>If you're coming from classes, you might be tempted to always call <code>useState()</code> once and put all state into a single object. You can do it if you'd like. Here is an example of a component that follows the mouse movement. We keep its position and size in the local state:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token maybe-class-name">Box</span></span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

  <span class="token comment">// ...</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>Now let's say we want to write some logic that changes <code>left</code> and <code>top</code> when the user moves their mouse. Note how we have to merge these fields into the previous state object manually:<pre class="language-js{4,5}"><code class="language-js{4,5}">  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleWindowMouseMove(e) {
      // Spreading "...state" ensures we don't "lose" width and height
      setState(state => ({ ...state, left: e.pageX, top: e.pageY }));
    }
    // Note: this implementation is a bit simplified
    window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleWindowMouseMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleWindowMouseMove);
  }, []);
  // ...</code></pre><p>This is because when we update a state variable, we <em>replace</em> its value. This is different from <code>this.setState</code> in a class, which <em>merges</em> the updated fields into the object.<p>If you miss automatic merging, you could write a custom <code>useLegacyState</code> Hook that merges object state updates. However, <strong>we recommend to split state into multiple state variables based on which values tend to change together.</strong><p>For example, we could split our component state into <code>position</code> and <code>size</code> objects, and always replace the <code>position</code> with no need for merging:<pre class="language-js{2,7}"><code class="language-js{2,7}">function Box() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ left: 0, top: 0 });
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 100, height: 100 });

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleWindowMouseMove(e) {
      setPosition({ left: e.pageX, top: e.pageY });
    }
    // ...</code></pre><p>Separating independent state variables also has another benefit. It makes it easy to later extract some related logic into a custom Hook, for example:<pre class="language-js{2,7}"><code class="language-js{2,7}">function Box() {
  const position = useWindowPosition();
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 100, height: 100 });
  // ...
}

function useWindowPosition() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ left: 0, top: 0 });
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
  return position;
}</code></pre><p>Note how we were able to move the <code>useState</code> call for the <code>position</code> state variable and the related effect into a custom Hook without changing their code. If all state was in a single object, extracting it would be more difficult.<p>Both putting all state in a single <code>useState</code> call, and having a <code>useState</code> call per each field can work. Components tend to be most readable when you find a balance between these two extremes, and group related state into a few independent state variables. If the state logic becomes complex, we recommend <a href="./hooks-reference.html#usereducer">managing it with a reducer</a> or a custom Hook.</section><section id="can-i-run-an-effect-only-on-updates"class="level3"><h3>Can I run an effect only on updates?</h3><p>This is a rare use case. If you need it, you can <a href="#is-there-something-like-instance-variables">use a mutable ref</a> to manually store a boolean value corresponding to whether you are on the first or a subsequent render, then check that flag in your effect. (If you find yourself doing this often, you could create a custom Hook for it.)</section><section id="how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state"class="level3"><h3>How to get the previous props or state?</h3><p>Currently, you can do it manually <a href="#is-there-something-like-instance-variables">with a ref</a>:<pre class="language-js{6,8}"><code class="language-js{6,8}">function Counter() {

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const calculation = count + 100;
  const prevCalculation = usePrevious(calculation);
  // ...</code></pre><p>It's possible that in the future React will provide a <code>usePrevious</code> Hook out of the box since it's a relatively common use case.<p>See also <a href="#how-do-i-implement-getderivedstatefromprops">the recommended pattern for derived state</a>.</section><section id="why-am-i-seeing-stale-props-or-state-inside-my-function"class="level3"><h3>Why am I seeing stale props or state inside my function?</h3><p>Any function inside a component, including event handlers and effects, "sees" the props and state from the render it was created in.

Here is a <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/l7m0v5x4v9">small demo</a>:<pre class="language-js{4-8,12}"><code class="language-js{4-8,12}">function MeasureExample() {

Using a callback ref ensures that <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/818zzk8m78">even if a child component displays the measured node later</a> (e.g. in response to a click), we still get notified about it in the parent component and can update the measurements.<p>Note that we pass <code>[]</code> as a dependency array to <code>useCallback</code>. This ensures that our ref callback doesn't change between the re-renders, and so React won't call it unnecessarily.<p>In this example, the callback ref will be called only when the component mounts and unmounts, since the rendered <code>&#x3C;h1></code> component stays present throughout any rerenders.

}</code></pre><p>The empty set of dependencies, <code>[]</code>, means that the effect will only run once when the component mounts, and not on every re-render. The problem is that inside the <code>setInterval</code> callback, the value of <code>count</code> does not change, because we've created a closure with the value of <code>count</code> set to <code>0</code> as it was when the effect callback ran. Every second, this callback then calls <code>setCount(0 + 1)</code>, so the count never goes above 1.<p>Specifying <code>[count]</code> as a list of dependencies would fix the bug, but would cause the interval to be reset on every change. Effectively, each <code>setInterval</code> would get one chance to execute before being cleared (similar to a <code>setTimeout</code>.) That may not be desirable. To fix this, we can use the <a href="./hooks-reference.html#functional-updates">functional update form of <code>setState</code></a>. It lets us specify <em>how</em> the state needs to change without referencing the <em>current</em> state:<pre class="language-js{6,9}"><code class="language-js{6,9}">function Counter() {

  return &#x3C;h1>{count}&#x3C;/h1>;
}</code></pre><p>(The identity of the <code>setCount</code> function is guaranteed to be stable so it's safe to omit.)<p>Now, the <code>setInterval</code> callback executes once a second, but each time the inner call to <code>setCount</code> can use an up-to-date value for <code>count</code> (called <code>c</code> in the callback here.)<p>In more complex cases (such as if one state depends on another state), try moving the state update logic outside the effect with the <a href="./hooks-reference.html#usereducer"><code>useReducer</code> Hook</a>. <a href="https://adamrackis.dev/state-and-use-reducer/">This article</a> offers an example of how you can do this. <strong>The identity of the <code>dispatch</code> function from <code>useReducer</code> is always stable</strong> — even if the reducer function is declared inside the component and reads its props.<p>As a last resort, if you want something like <code>this</code> in a class, you can <a href="./hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-instance-variables">use a ref</a> to hold a mutable variable.

Even though it is more explicit, it can feel like a lot of "plumbing".<p>In large component trees, an alternative we recommend is to pass down a <code>dispatch</code> function from <a href="./hooks-reference.html#usereducer"><code>useReducer</code></a> via context:<pre class="language-js{4,5}"><code class="language-js{4,5}">const TodosDispatch = React.createContext(null);

function TodosApp() {
  // Note: `dispatch` won't change between re-renders
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer);

  return (

      &#x3C;DeepTree todos={todos} />
    &#x3C;/TodosDispatch.Provider>
  );
}</code></pre><p>Any child in the tree inside <code>TodosApp</code> can use the <code>dispatch</code> function to pass actions up to <code>TodosApp</code>:<pre class="language-js{2,3}"><code class="language-js{2,3}">function DeepChild(props) {
  // If we want to perform an action, we can get dispatch from context.
  const dispatch = useContext(TodosDispatch);

  function handleClick() {
    dispatch({ type: 'add', text: 'hello' });
  }

  return (
    &#x3C;button onClick={handleClick}>Add todo&#x3C;/button>
  );
}</code></pre><p>This is both more convenient from the maintenance perspective (no need to keep forwarding callbacks), and avoids the callback problem altogether. Passing <code>dispatch</code> down like this is the recommended pattern for deep updates.<p>Note that you can still choose whether to pass the application <em>state</em> down as props (more explicit) or as context (more convenient for very deep updates). If you use context to pass down the state too, use two different context types -- the <code>dispatch</code> context never changes, so components that read it don't need to rerender unless they also need the application state.</section><section id="how-to-read-an-often-changing-value-from-usecallback"class="level3"><h3>How to read an often-changing value from <code>useCallback</code>?</h3><blockquote><p>Note<p>We recommend to <a href="#how-to-avoid-passing-callbacks-down">pass <code>dispatch</code> down in context</a> rather than individual callbacks in props.

If the function you're memoizing is an event handler and isn't used during rendering, you can use <a href="#is-there-something-like-instance-variables">ref as an instance variable</a>, and save the last committed value into it manually:<pre class="language-js{6,10}"><code class="language-js{6,10}">function Form() {

  const [text, updateText] = useState('');
  // Will be memoized even if `text` changes:
