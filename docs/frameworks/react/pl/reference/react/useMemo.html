You will then see logs like <code>filter array: 0.15ms</code> in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, <code>1ms</code> or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in <code>useMemo</code> to verify whether the total logged time has decreased for that interaction or not:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token console class-name">console</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">time</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'filter array'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

It only helps you skip unnecessary work on updates.<p>Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users' so it's a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-61/#throttling">CPU Throttling</a> option for this.<p>Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when <a href="/reference/react/StrictMode">Strict Mode</a> is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have.</section></deepdive><deepdive><section class="level4"aria-labelledby="should-you-add-usememo-everywhere-should-you-add-usememo-everywhere"><h4 id="should-you-add-usememo-everywhere-should-you-add-usememo-everywhere">Should you add useMemo everywhere? {/<em>should-you-add-usememo-everywhere</em>/}</h4><p>If your app is like this site, and most interactions are coarse (like replacing a page or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful.<p>Optimizing with <code>useMemo</code> is only valuable in a few cases:<ul><li>The calculation you're putting in <code>useMemo</code> is noticeably slow, and its dependencies rarely change.<li>You pass it as a prop to a component wrapped in <a href="/reference/react/memo"><code>memo</code>.</a> You want to skip re-rendering if the value hasn't changed. Memoization lets your component re-render only when dependencies aren't the same.<li>The value you're passing is later used as a dependency of some Hook. For example, maybe another <code>useMemo</code> calculation value depends on it. Or maybe you are depending on this value from <a href="/reference/react/useEffect"><code>useEffect.</code></a></ul><p>There is no benefit to wrapping a calculation in <code>useMemo</code> in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside of this approach is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that's "always new" is enough to break memoization for an entire component.<p><strong>In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles:</strong><ol><li>When a component visually wraps other components, let it <a href="/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children">accept JSX as children.</a> This way, when the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don't need to re-render.<li>Prefer local state and don't <a href="/learn/sharing-state-between-components">lift state up</a> any further than necessary. For example, don't keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library.<li>Keep your <a href="/learn/keeping-components-pure">rendering logic pure.</a> If re-rendering a component causes a problem or produces some noticeable visual artifact, it's a bug in your component! Fix the bug instead of adding memoization.<li>Avoid <a href="/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect">unnecessary Effects that update state.</a> Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over.<li>Try to <a href="/learn/removing-effect-dependencies">remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.</a> For example, instead of memoization, it's often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component.</ol><p>If a specific interaction still feels laggy, <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html">use the React Developer Tools profiler</a> to see which components would benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it's good to follow them in any case. In the long term, we're researching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc">doing granular memoization automatically</a> to solve this once and for all.</section></deepdive><recipes titletext="The difference between useMemo and calculating a value directly"titleid="examples-recalculation"><section class="level4"aria-labelledby="skipping-recalculation-with-usememo-skipping-recalculation-with-usememo"><h4 id="skipping-recalculation-with-usememo-skipping-recalculation-with-usememo">Skipping recalculation with <code>useMemo</code> {/<em>skipping-recalculation-with-usememo</em>/}</h4><p>In this example, the <code>filterTodos</code> implementation is <strong>artificially slowed down</strong> so that you can see what happens when some JavaScript function you're calling during rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.<p>Switching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down <code>filterTodos</code> to re-execute. That's expected because the <code>tab</code> has changed, and so the entire calculation <em>needs</em> to re-run. (If you're curious why it runs twice, it's explained <a href="#my-calculation-runs-twice-on-every-re-render">here.</a>)<p>Toggle the theme. <strong>Thanks to <code>useMemo</code>, it's fast despite the artificial slowdown!</strong> The slow <code>filterTodos</code> call was skipped because both <code>todos</code> and <code>tab</code> (which you pass as dependencies to <code>useMemo</code>) haven't changed since the last render.</p><sandpack><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> useState <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">'react'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.<p>Unlike in the previous example, toggling the theme is also slow now! This is because <strong>there is no <code>useMemo</code> call in this version,</strong> so the artificially slowed down <code>filterTodos</code> gets called on every re-render.

If your interactions are fast enough, you might not need memoization.<p>You can try increasing the number of todo items in <code>utils.js</code> and see how the behavior changes. This particular calculation wasn't very expensive to begin with, but if the number of todos grows significantly, most of the overhead will be in re-rendering rather than in the filtering. Keep reading below to see how you can optimize re-rendering with <code>useMemo</code>.</p><solution></solution></section></recipes></section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="skipping-re-rendering-of-components-skipping-re-rendering-of-components"><h3 id="skipping-re-rendering-of-components-skipping-re-rendering-of-components">Skipping re-rendering of components {/<em>skipping-re-rendering-of-components</em>/}</h3><p>In some cases, <code>useMemo</code> can also help you optimize performance of re-rendering child components.

This tells you that it's worth trying to optimize the <code>List</code> component.<p><strong>By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively.</strong> This is why, when <code>TodoList</code> re-renders with a different <code>theme</code>, the <code>List</code> component <em>also</em> re-renders. This is fine for components that don't require much calculation to re-render.

If the <code>visibleTodos</code> haven't changed, <code>List</code> won't be re-rendered.<p>A JSX node like <code>&#x3C;List items={visibleTodos} /></code> is an object like <code>{ type: List, props: { items: visibleTodos } }</code>. Creating this object is very cheap, but React doesn't know whether its contents is the same as last time or not. This is why by default, React will re-render the <code>List</code> component.<p>However, if React sees the same exact JSX as during the previous render, it won't try to re-render your component. This is because JSX nodes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable.</a> A JSX node object could not have changed over time, so React knows it's safe to skip a re-render. However, for this to work, the node has to <em>actually be the same object</em>, not merely look the same in code. This is what <code>useMemo</code> does in this example.<p>Manually wrapping JSX nodes into <code>useMemo</code> is not convenient. For example, you can't do this conditionally. This is usually why you would wrap components with <a href="/reference/react/memo"><code>memo</code></a> instead of wrapping JSX nodes.</section></deepdive><recipes titletext="The difference between skipping re-renders and always re-rendering"titleid="examples-rerendering"><section class="level4"aria-labelledby="skipping-re-rendering-with-usememo-and-memo-skipping-re-rendering-with-usememo-and-memo"><h4 id="skipping-re-rendering-with-usememo-and-memo-skipping-re-rendering-with-usememo-and-memo">Skipping re-rendering with <code>useMemo</code> and <code>memo</code> {/<em>skipping-re-rendering-with-usememo-and-memo</em>/}</h4><p>In this example, the <code>List</code> component is <strong>artificially slowed down</strong> so that you can see what happens when a React component you're rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.<p>Switching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down <code>List</code> to re-render. That's expected because the <code>tab</code> has changed, and so you need to reflect the user's new choice on the screen.<p>Next, try toggling the theme. <strong>Thanks to <code>useMemo</code> together with <a href="/reference/react/memo"><code>memo</code></a>, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown!</strong> The <code>List</code> skipped re-rendering because the <code>visibleTodos</code> array has not changed since the last render. The <code>visibleTodos</code> array has not changed because both <code>todos</code> and <code>tab</code> (which you pass as dependencies to <code>useMemo</code>) haven't changed since the last render.</p><sandpack><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> useState <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">'react'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

As long as your component and calculation functions are pure, this shouldn't affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice and fix the mistake.<p>For example, this impure calculation function mutates an array you received as a prop:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">  <span class="token keyword">const</span> visibleTodos <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">useMemo</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token arrow operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
